I have found that the DS3231 on the cheap knock off boards can be hard to set when they are first powered up. Sometimes I have to upload this sketch a couple of times to get the date and time to "take", but they seem to run fine after that. 

Note: Upload some other sketch (like "blink") immediately after running this utility! Or the next time you power up the clock will be set incorrectly.
